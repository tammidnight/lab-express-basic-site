        <h1>About Stephen Hawking</h1>
        <h3>Key facts</h3>
        <p>
          Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 â€“ 14 March
          2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author
          who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology
          at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death.[18][19][8] He
          was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of
          Cambridge between 1979 and 2009. Hawking was born in Oxford, into a
          family of doctors. He began his university education at University
          College, Oxford, in October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a
          first-class BA degree in physics. He began his graduate work at
          Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962, where he obtained his PhD
          degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in
          general relativity and cosmology in March 1966. In 1963, Hawking was
          diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone
          disease that gradually paralysed him over the decades.[20][21] After
          the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating
          device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by
          using a single cheek muscle.

        <h3>Personal life</h3>
        <p>
          Hawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962. The
          following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. In
          October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the
          potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking's shortened life
          expectancy and physical limitations. Hawking later said that the
          engagement gave him "something to live for". The two were married on
          14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans.

        <h3>Early Education</h3>
        <p>
          Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate,
          London. He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to
          learn to read while at the school. In St Albans, the eight-year-old
          Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At
          that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses. Hawking
          attended two independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett
          School and from September 1952, St Albans School, after passing the
          eleven-plus a year early. The family placed a high value on education.
          Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded
          Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of
          the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school
          fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained
          at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close
          to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the
          manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long
          discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958
          on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built
          a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other
          recycled components. Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking
          was not initially successful academically. With time, he began to show
          considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta,
          decided to read mathematics at university. Hawking's father advised
          him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for
          mathematics graduates. He also wanted his son to attend University
          College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not possible to read
          mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and
          chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next
          year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations
          in March 1959.

        <h3>Disability</h3>
        <p>
          Hawking had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone
          disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou
          Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the
          motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed
          him over decades. Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during
          his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and
          difficulties when rowing. The problems worsened, and his speech became
          slightly slurred. His family noticed the changes when he returned home
          for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun. The MND
          diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963. At the time, doctors gave
          him a life expectancy of two years. In the late 1960s, Hawking's
          physical abilities declined: he began to use crutches and could no
          longer give lectures regularly. As he slowly lost the ability to
          write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing
          equations in terms of geometry. The physicist Werner Israel later
          compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in
          his head. Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept
          help or make concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be
          regarded as "a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in
          all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires,
          drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person." His wife, Jane
          Hawking, later noted: "Some people would call it determination, some
          obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another." He required
          much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the
          1960s, but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his
          wheelchair driving. Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his
          illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from
          some.
